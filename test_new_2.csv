They have nice bathrooms with working sinks, a working gardening section, comfortable classes, nice track field, nice tennis courts, they even have solar panels and more. Comparing them to schools in Vallejo, we do not have better quality schools like they have. The bathrooms are raggedy, the sinks do not completely work, most lockers do not work, the basket ball quarts are old and most schools do not even have a gardening section.

Waterfront Skate/BMX/Scooter Park;The current waterfront plans don't appear to include anything geared towards the youth. Concrete skate parks provide the best ROI (return on investment) for the cities that build them. They are extremely low maintenance, provide a safe space for healthy activities, and when built to the proper scale they become a destination for end users from all over the region. The new park in Napa is an excellent example of this. Vallejo could do one better by placing it at the waterfront & thereby putting the park in an area easily accessible by many forms of transportation. It would also be closer to businesses which will benefit from added traffic by not only the users of the park, but also by those (such as parents) that may transport or accompany users of the park.

Encouraging Business Advancement ;I have been a citizen of Vallejo since 2001.For the past six years, I have been a resident of the  College Park neighborhood of Northern Vallejo. As everyone knows, a few months ago, Food 4 Less closed for business permanently. Currently, there are sparse business establishments in that shopping square. I propose an idea that more businesses are installed. It is in a good location and easily accessible for both patrons of Vallejo, American Canyon, Napa and surrounding towns. Several years ago when Walmart moved from Vallejo to American Canyon, there were promises of a Home Depot being placed there. But so far, I have not seen any progress being made  into this project. I don't know if the plan was just hearsay or the building project was detained due to low funding. But whatever the reason,  the building has been trespassed by transients in the past. I realize that the homeless situation in Vallejo is unfortunately prevalent. Personally,  I feel that if more businesses were brought into that shopping square, it would bring in new job opportunities for the citizens of Vallejo. It would also give the homeless an opportunity to get on their feet and get a chance of living productive lives for themselves and their families. The plazas where Century Theaters and Seafood City are situated are doing pretty well for themselves business-wise. It would be wonderful and a great business advancement to see an additional plaza in Vallejo doing successfully as well.;retail
Vallejo education ;As residents here in Vallejo and have the ability to considered one idea in the Vallejo participatory budget process I request a better education. Just as here in the Vallejo high schools we have a low ranking of our schools. Our community should improve this problem as Vallejo schools don't have good material which makes  people believe that Vallejo schools are bad and not learning schools. As a resident here in Vallejo and I had the experience in attending both high schools in Vallejo we need to make a change for our community education. We need to improve  our security,classrooms, bathrooms, cafeteria  and teachers. Security in Vallejo schools have been a big problem us students here in Vallejo don't feel safe as recently these pass years we had big lockdowns and death. We need to improve Vallejo schools and make a change. The classrooms need more modern look just as the generation is changing and we are being paperless. Also bathrooms should be remolded and maintain clean. Also the cafeteria should also be remolded and we shouldn't have frozen food  they want us to eat healthy but is frozen food  healthy? No it's not we should have fresh food. Lastly, Vallejo teachers should be trained in the new technology. Teachers here in Vallejo don't know how to use of the new material. Us residents of Vallejo we should make a change of our education community.;school

extend bart to vallejo;Traffic in the bay area is no joke, especially when you're in a rush to get somewhere important. Due to this situation, many people depend on Bart. I believe that the extension of Bart would be of great use in the city of Vallejo and the North Bay. Bart is critical for many people to get to their desired destination. However, Vallejo is in absence of the Bart experience. The closest stations to Vallejo are either Concord, El Cerrito and/or Richmond. All of the stations are still a commuting distance, meaning people would still need to drive down there, and at the same time polluting the air we breath. Bart wouldn't just help the people in our community by saving them gas money and saving them time, but it will also help our natural environment. With the reduction of automobiles being drove and the reduction of emissions entering our environment, we'd be helping this planet of ours. After all we do only have one planet earth. ;transport
Improvement to the VCUSD;"If I was given money through the Participatory Budget, I would do anything to make our Vallejo schools better environment. I, as a student, have witnessed our deteriorated, filthy, gross, and unattainable environment in our schools. Our schools are molded with black gums stained all over the cement, and marinated with urine on the bathroom tiles, and unsanitized classrooms. Our breakfast and lunch meals are like prison food that we, students, have to force ourselves to like the taste or eventually - throw it in the trash; thus, we waste food. Most students address the fact about using bathrooms is rare and only necessary, meaning our bathrooms are unclean and unhygienic. For example, the common knowledge that we already know there isn‚Äôt any toilet paper or soap illustrates how dirty our schools can be. When we walk in classrooms, the air isn‚Äôt fresh to breathe. We wish for air conditioners to work perfectly, but not all classrooms have one nor does it function properly. Another concern is the classes we take. Although our schools choose our classes based on the A-G requirements, we wish for classes that relate to hands-on classes like cooking, to let us focus and apply the ability to real-life skills that could lead us for adulthood, college, or a new hobby. The last thing I would spend money on through this budget, is by hiring teachers who have a well advised credibility through their profile because more appropriate teaching skills means a higher chance a student will understand their classes and a higher rate of students passing their classes and graduating. 

Schools are important to create an environment suitable for students for a better education. We go to school that is part of our lives for at least 12 years from where we not only learn, but we socialize and are raised in the Vallejo city that causes our behaviors to lead to a positive effect or a negative effect. We all should acknowledge the fact our schools really make a huge impact in our lives(not just children and teenagers, but teachers, families, parents, the Superintendent - the whole Vallejo City Unified School District) and by improving the the schools where we sit in class for 7 hours a day can really motivate students the will to learn and not give up in their education.";school

Mindfulness in Education ;"The effectiveness of mindfulness to transform our schools, communities and our worlds is an unparalleled force and it's just the beginning.  The studies of Jon Kabat Zinn who took hospital patients with chronic pain and taught them mindfulness (later termed MBSR-mindfulness based stress reduction) had wild findings.  Many patients reported having dramatically less pain.  What happened?  They learned how to be in relationship with what is in a way that did not continue the emotional & physical inflammation in response to it.  This in turn created less pain. After Jon Kabat Zin pioneered mindfulness in hospitals school based curriculum is now available and is very effective!  Mindfulness helps children learn to self regulate and calm down effectively bringing their logical mind back on board when upset and able to make good decisions.  Another facet of mindfulness is that it develops loving kindness practices and this offers practice to our children and ourselves to look to each other with compassion overcoming impulses towards aggression; learning how to breathe, calm down & make good choices.

Solano Middle School Crosswalk Project - 1025 Corcoran Avenue;"Solano Middle School, located on Corcoran Avenue in North Vallejo, should have a crosswalk in front of the school.  This project would not only benefit students arriving/departing to/from school each day, but the residents that live in a gated community across the street from Solano Middle School as well.  A SolTrans bus stop is located directly across from the driveway of the gated homes, but the closest place to cross the street safely is a 1/4 mile in the west direction, and about half that distance in the east direction.  During drop off/pickup times before and after school, the amount of traffic creates an unsafe environment for students. Students have no designated safe place to cross the street, so they do so at their own risk.  Solano Middle School and its students should be able to arrive at and depart from school without having to fear for their safety in the process.  



The cost for this project, according to the City of Vallejo Public Works Department, is $26.000.  



The installation of a crosswalk requires that the crosswalk meet ADA standards and must include handicap accessible ramps on the each side.  The VCUSD claims that funding is not available for such a project.  This idea is an effort to reach out to the community & hopefully make Corcoran Avenue a safer place to cross the street in North Vallejo.";traffic control

Making Vallejo Schools Better;"     I believe the city of Vallejo should spend Measure B tax dollars on making the schools in Vallejo better. Education is a huge part of who we are and how we move forward with our lives. Being a high school student at Jesse M. Bethel High School, I want my peers, as well as the future students to have a true education. Most teachers aren't willing to put their full effort towards teaching their students and the learning environment in Vallejo is not the best. With putting money towards the schools, the city of Vallejo can truly make an impact on the people who have grown up here and reside here. Walking around my high school, I am always seeing vandalism on the walls and trash scattered all over the floor. Putting money towards the school systems can truly make our lives great. 

     With the Measure B tax dollars, schools can take their students on more educational field trips. For example, high school students should be able to be exposed to seeing colleges and learning what they have to offer so they can move forward with their lives after college. There are a class set of textbooks in each class but, they are torn apart and written all over, with the money we can be able to replace these books with new ones. At Jesse M. Bethel, we have to chance to use Ipads for our education and that was a great step to enhancing our education. We need more reasons to be pushed to move forward after high school as well. Kids who attend school during elementary shouldn't have to play in playgrounds that are written all over with foul language. With extra money, we can have these kids play in new playgrounds. With putting money towards our school systems, we don't only change our education but, the future for all students. It will give them a sense of hope that their education does not end after high school.  ";school

Mentors for Struggling Students in Vallejo;Hello! My name is Angelica Maligat and I would like for you to consider starting a program designed for on-campus ‚Ä?mentors‚Äù at the schools here in Vallejo. I find that a major issue for some students within the schools is the lack of desire for their education, which is such a missed opportunity. These students are either unfocused during class, avoiding work, or even skipping school and/or classes altogether. With this program, these students in need of help can consult with someone older, as young as a college student or even a senior citizen, who has lived with the same lifestyle the students are currently living, how it was leading them towards the wrong path and their experiences and motivation to turn it around. In results of this program, we should be able to see a large strive forward in getting kids to grasp their education while they can so we can create a better image for Vallejo schools and it‚Äôs students. ;mentoring
Future Projects;"We need the following stores in Vallejo somewhere in the area by the Columbus Parkway Automall area where the Solano Community College is at by Lowes, Toyota, etc.  We also need to build a Super Center Walmart back in Vallejo where it use to be located at the Meadows Plaza.  That area is a sore eye since Walmart left, now it's just a wasted dead parking lot with growing weeds and more empty spaces since Food Max also left and Home Depot has deserted the space.  Build a Trader Joes food store in Vallejo, a Vegas Style Casino in Mare Island, more retail businesses, food buffet restaurants, etc.  This will bring more people to Vallejo instead of always driving to Fairfield to go to Trader Joes or San Francisco.  There is a lot of empty spaces along Sonoma with nothing but huge weeds growing near the Meadows Plaza with no businesses, why?  If Vallejo had the big Vegas Style Casino that was offered numerous times by the Indians at Mare Island, more people would've visited by now.  We could've had the Olympics held in the Bay Area by now.  Wake up and see that people are interested in Action, not going to an Industrial former Naval Base with past memories of the Military.  It would be nice to lower the monthly costs of the Ferry prices and free parking for hard working people trying to make ends meet.  All this time, and Vallejo still doesn't have it together by now.  We need NEW LEADERS who aren't afraid to take a chance and do something different, make it happen, earn interest instead of debt, give consumers what they're asking for.

Public Beach at historical dry docks, Mare Island;I propose that one or both of the old, unused dry-docks directly across the Napa River from the Vallejo Ferry Building be transformed into a public sun and swimming location. I envision towels, blankets and picnickers spread across the concrete slope as it makes its way towards the water. In the water, children play and teenagers and adults swim out within the guarding presence of the tall structured walls. Picnic tables and barbecue pits inhabit the western end towards the road. I believe this would create a public beach, something lacking in the Bay Area, and provide a free, natural alternative to the paid, chlorinated swimming pools. It would incorporate the history of the island and the city and provide a unique tourism destination as well as a resource for the city and its citizens. ;park

Vallejo Indy Film Class: Youth-Crew only HD Video feature film;"Funds are for VALLEJO INDY FILM CLASS: a Youth-only Crew for a High-Definition Video Feature Film project, July 2017. Project submitted by experienced small film writer-producer, local downtown artist Julian Phillips. Seeking $50,000 and up, to finance such as: a) ten to fifteen high-school students will participate on project for six months, July 2017 to Jan. 2018. b) under supervision, students will contract to create and produce all aspects of a 90-minute Independent Feature Film. c) work will proceed in Vallejo and locations nearby; students can be as creative as they wish within normal guidelines for drama, comedy, 'action', documentary, science-fiction, at least 90-min. d) completed 90-min feature film will become the property of the City of Vallejo under PB process terms. e) funds needed to operate a six-month 'after school' or 'weekends only' class or program, including field work and on-set locations, minor personal travel. Examples would include rental cameras, edit-bay, lights, costumes, props, permits and insurance, casting, music. f) Mr. Phillips may, or may not, be the Team Leader. Mr. Phillips is a downtown artist (known for his Twofish Guitar Shows), and has been teaching media arts classes since 2009, including award-winning entries in last year's Waterfront Weekend 'Troll Story' contest, written by students from his American Canyon classes. Other local video artists and teachers would be invited to lead. g) funds would necessarily provide a small 'stipend fee', for all participants, to motivate students (at for example $75 per month, each), and also secure semi-professional status and credits. h) ten to fifteen students (high school level or proficient), would take on all film-maker duties, such as cast or dramatic actors, camera and sound/lights, costumes, script and screenplay writing, director or team of directors, film-video editor(s), producer, computer, etc. The entire group would work together for six months on all aspects. i) by the end of the Class, students can recieve DVD copies of their work, can earn school credits, are awarded certificate of acheivement, can apply screen credits for professional Unions (such as SAG), and follow-up with distribution and release of the film-video, online such as Vimeo or Amazon Prime, and locally with a big Premiere Party (Empress Theater or similar venue), for the entire community to enjoy the finished film. 



The project would function much like a 'part time job' for teens and high school students interested in film-video arts. Six month's time period for completion would allow successful editing, post-production. Finished film could be entered in film-festivals, created as a web-series, and build resumes and confidence. Students may be low-income or from abusive backgrounds, (with guidance). Vallejo High School and City of Vallejo would be invited to participate in the process on certain aspects

In Vallejo our city has no real community establishment that can bring families closer and the community also. This can also bring in lots of attention to vallejo and make us also profit from it. I propose they we should make a sports complex which will have soccer/Football fields and baseball fields and maybe a gym for volleyball. Making this might be expensive but in the long run we can receive back the money we put into it by hosting tournaments for different sports also having fees to have teams practice there. With this we can now be a stop for people across the bay area thus the environment of vallejo will change and will make vallejo more friendly. ;sports

Outlets Proposal;"Shopping outlets are a place where people can relax, do some retail therapy, and also get away from what they may face outside of that shopping center.

Vallejo is a community that is filled with exploring adolescents and people with beautiful characteristics. However, due to Vallejo being seen as a ‚Ä?ghetto‚Äù community by those who live outside of the city, the children and people can sometimes believe what they hear and not expect better from themselves. With this in mind, a shopping center/outlet can bring unity to the city by people, instead of being on the streets for various reasons, enjoying time in the outlets.  In addition to the outlets being a sort of get a way, the outlets bring the opportunity to get Vallejo to flourish even more into a well-developed city and can bring in money to the city.  Although the cost to build an outlet maybe be on the expensive side, the income of the outlets are more beneficial, giving this project more positives than negatives.";retail
Mare Island Cooperatives;The city could use land on Mare Island to support community cooperatives that would provide training and employment. A community goat farm would not only keep the weeds down and reduce fire danger, but also produce local artisanal cheeses.

Cottage industries of this type on the island would be a proud Vallejo industry that people from the region would like to visit as opposed to a cement plant. There are myriad benefits of the community participating in producing quality food goods, as well as owning the means of producing such goods. ;retail

Vallejo Schools (High Schools) Bathroom problem & educational quality;"As a fourth-year high school student in Jesse Bethel, I have noticed many things I and fellow peers have grown critical over. The wide spread complaint all students share would be the issues with our restrooms. They are unsanitary and without resources. There is never any soap, tissue, working locks in the bathroom stalls, adequate mirrors or lighting. Out of all the things we request to be fixed in our school, restrooms would be a great place to start. Having a restroom is a necessity in the 7 hours we are in school, but the horrible state it is in discourages many students from actually using them. Also, not having any soap is completely unsanitary after using the toilet and can spread germs after leaving the restroom. Fixing the state of our restrooms would improve the quality of comfort in Jesse Bethel, and other schools as well if implemented to all Vallejo schools.

Another thing I found to be frustrating is the academy structure. While some believe it is helpful for students to explore fields in their desired profession, it creates more confusion for undecided students and wastes one period with an academy class they are uninterested in. I propose an investment on increasing educational program quality in Vallejo high schools to assist students in finding potential interests for a future profession. I believe they can do this in two ways. The academy structure does not have to fully disappear. But the addition of giving the students a chance to not claim an academy or having students be able to experience all academies would be a great addition to give students more autonomy of their own educational experience. Letting a student experience all academies and not having to commit to one allows them to experiment with completely different fields to determine which suits them best. This system is helpful for the completely oblivious and indecisive students who are interested in a myriad of subjects. The other choice to allow a no academy allows students to explore interests through the classes they choose. For example, they can choose extra math classes or elective classes to explore their interests which they may have been unable to do if their schedules were blocked by an academy class. This leads to my other point to invest in our educational programs, such as physical education, science, and art departments. A higher quality education would involve a higher quality and quantity resources to improve and expand our learning abilities. For example, lab equipment to perform more lab experiments in our science classes. Also, the creation of varied classes would help students experiment with new subjects. These improvements can outcome in a higher student involvement and interest in education and a further exploration of career choices.";school

Not only will this be beneficial to the environment, but it can be beneficial to the visitors/newcomers as well. It won‚Äôt hurt to clean our city just a bit, considering that animals around here are feeding off of the garbage being thrown around.

This isn‚Äôt needed just around neighborhoods, but around Vallejo schools as well. Students should have the opportunity to help the custodians clean up our schools, and volunteer hours should also be given when completing this task. That way, we can convince students to make a difference as well as motivate them to earn volunteer hours, as this is an important factor to consider when applying to college. ";beautification

Electronic Books for Jesse Bethel High School + Ipads;"Jesse M. Bethel High School is in need of many improvements. For example, the teachers are working with such limited supplies; it could definitely be improved by adding more funds or giving more supplies to teachers. Additionally, the lack of extracurricular activities at Bethel‚Äîsports, events, etc.‚Äî is not selling to a lot of the students resulting in the lack of enthusiasm and community for those attending Bethel. Furthermore, students point out that some of the gym equipments are worn out and the new ones are usually given through donations. But out of all of these problems, the main problem that should be addressed is the lack of e-textbooks in Bethel.

The district has graciously given Bethel the amazing educational tool called the iPads. This tool has been quite helpful with the students by allowing us to create presentations, research, and edit videos. Though recently, I realized that there was an app in our iPads called Pearson e-text for schools. Sadly, since there wasn't any electronic textbooks that the school has bought, we were unable to use the app. 

With the recent change in math and English textbooks, teachers do not currently have any class sets for their students which means that they have to require students to carry those heavy textbooks. Fast Forward to today, the iPads now carries books for both math and English classes. As much as this is great news, the iPads still do not carry books for all classes, unlike American Canyon high school. This means that students still have to carry books for classes such as psychology, Spanish, and physics. I propose that the money that Vallejo will have, should be used to purchase the electronic version of the books that bethel has not purchased already. Also, not all academies have not received the iPads, so I also propose that the iPads should be purchased for each and every single one of the students at Jesse Bethel.";school

More Funding for Art Walk;We'd like to see the art walk further extended because it is great for the community.;events
Bike/Pedestrian Lanes;One day I decided to run from the Mare Island Bridge to the 37 bridge and go all the way around, and back. Although there was a slide walk from 37 bridge to the Mare Island Causeway, I noticed there was not a clear pedestrian lane going from the Mare Island Bridge to the 37 bridge. The bridge going to 37 does have an entrance for pedestrians/bikers, but weeds were growing at the entrance and it wasn't clear to me at the beginning where the entrance was. I believe supporting this issue would encourage more people to walk and explore both bridges and contribute to making Vallejo beautiful.;bikes

Sex Education Classes at Vallejo High Schools;"Students aren't getting educated about Sex. 

Vallejo has the highest rate of Chlamydia infection in Solano County.

Misinformation is running rampant among young adults. Kids are making very poorly informed decisions. Help educate them please. Having an advice nurse available would good to. Someone we can confide in when we have questions or are in trouble. ";health

Trash Can Screens;The City of Vallejo is currently not enforcing the city code that trash cans must be kept out of view. The reason I was given was that the some people with older homes simply have no place to store them. While I like that the city is being sensitive to individuals needs, I still find seeing trash cans to be an eyesore and source of urban blight. I think a solution could be to meet with citizens who aren't complying with the code, see if there is any way for them to comply and if not, build a screen for them to put their cans behind. This would cost fairly little money. I imagine that the screens could be built by an organization that helps folks fix up their homes. I know there is such a group that does work here in town, but I can't think of the name! The screens though, would not just be for low income folks, it could be any income level. I think something this simple would really improve the looks of our town.;beautification
More homeless shelters;throughout Vallejo. There is not enough. ;homeless
Yoga Program for most challenged schools in the district;"Yoga has a proven positive impact on children's ability to focus, their resiliency, and their behavior. If a major goal of the school district is to make the schools safer, a yoga program with a strong record of success would be advisable. 

I would suggest Niroga Yoga, which handles yoga for youth programs in schools in San Leandro, Oakland, Richmond, Berkeley and others. They have a well established, thoroughly researched program and years of experience bringing this program to schools.

Substandard and Dangerous Paving;"When I voted for Measure B, I was under the impression I was voting for our ridiculously un-maintained street paving phenomenon to END, ensuring driver safety and an end to the high costs associated with wheel alignments, popped tires and the now-necessary to drive with...sports bras.

While heavily trafficked residential side-streets and main arteries become riddled with recurrent, deep trenches, I was quite perturbed a couple years ago to witness the City boldly ordered and paid for a very expensive, permanent-type white metal refective street large sign (approx. 1.5' x 1') to be erected at the entrance to Crownpointe, a recently re-paved street. I was already questioning the logic in repaving this previously well-maintained street before the sign went up. Did our Measure B tax dollars actually budget for these permanent (although temporary since they were soon removed) reflective street signs merely to brag/impress someone on this obscure, under-traveled residential court? What a waste of money! Where's the logic and accountability?

I also think it was wrong and insulting to see residents being asked to foot this neglect, waste and abuse on the recent ballot, as if we don't learn from our mistakes.  Is Vallejo hoping we will soon become desperate enough (again) to foot the bill ourselves out of good will? Sadly, we did this with Measure B and learned our lesson.

Let's stick with the real reason we voted for Measure B in the first place and stop squandering the money on other, made-up, unnecessary suggestions and fix our streets ONCE (TWICE?) AND  FOR ALL!";road repair

Drivers Education at High Schools;"     With teens on the road nowadays, its only fair that they get some practice in some sort of program that is free. This will help students get the hang of driving much faster and will have them ready to take their test at the D.M.V. Drivers ed in high schools is becoming less common, it kind of sucks how some teens are forced to go to the D.M.V. to take their driving lessons now. The bad thing about this is that if they were to fail, they have to wait 2 weeks to take it again.

     Parents are also effected by this since now they have to teach their children how to drive with the risk of damage to their car. Re-adding this drivers ed program can help out teens and their parents, this could also prevent crashes and accidents since teens will have had better practice driving with the program than they would with their parents car. Putting this programs in high schools will relieve parents of the stress of thionking their child might not be able to obtain a license.";school

From the mind of a teenager;I believe that Vallejo would benefit from having BART installed. The extension of BART to Vallejo combined with the bus system will be the most service and cost effective transit services. With a new bridge to be built at Carquinez Strait, BART could operate to Vallejo. There are people who travel to ride BART but because Richmond is a bad neighborhood, many go to the El Cerrito del Norte station. This causes this station to be overflowing and packed with frustrated people everyday. If BART is installed in Vallejo, traffic would clear up and the people would be happy.;transport

Before there are roads that need fixing, today there are some roads that are fixed. However we want all roads, not just a small percentage.;road repair
