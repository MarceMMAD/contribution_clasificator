190445;Solano Middle School Crosswalk Project - 1025 Corcoran Avenue;"Solano Middle School, located on Corcoran Avenue in North Vallejo, should have a crosswalk in front of the school.  This project would not only benefit students arriving/departing to/from school each day, but the residents that live in a gated community across the street from Solano Middle School as well.  A SolTrans bus stop is located directly across from the driveway of the gated homes, but the closest place to cross the street safely is a 1/4 mile in the west direction, and about half that distance in the east direction.  During drop off/pickup times before and after school, the amount of traffic creates an unsafe environment for students. Students have no designated safe place to cross the street, so they do so at their own risk.  Solano Middle School and its students should be able to arrive at and depart from school without having to fear for their safety in the process.  



The cost for this project, according to the City of Vallejo Public Works Department, is $26.000.  



The installation of a crosswalk requires that the crosswalk meet ADA standards and must include handicap accessible ramps on the each side.  The VCUSD claims that funding is not available for such a project.  This idea is an effort to reach out to the community & hopefully make Corcoran Avenue a safer place to cross the street in North Vallejo.";traffic control

While current standards call for subterranean deployment of utilities, these areas are served by utility poles and overhead lines, items which take away from the beauty of these neighborhoods. 



This project would allow the City of Vallejo to work with utility companies and neighborhood homeowners to remove those wires and poles, redistributing existing services through underground cables. Potentially, new technology such as fiber optic to the home could be deployed as well. ";power

188181;The schools of Vallejo;Education is the most important factor in which Vallejo should focus on. The city of Vallejo has schools that are doing well, but the school and its students cannot flourish because of the limited amount of money invested in them. Education will never fail, putting in money into Vallejo schools will improve each child's performance, reduce crime rates, and attract more people into the city. One of the benefits that would serve Vallejo for the long run is having students in school instead of them roaming around the streets. Our students have the potential to thrive but the quality of the school is what discourages them and feel as if they are degraded by their neighboring cities. Investing money to the schools of Vallejo is like watering seeds, give the children more resources and they will revolutionize the face of Vallejo. Ultimately, the schools will improve and new families would want to come into what Vallejo truly is, rich in culture and diversity. Who wouldn't want to come into a city that accepts every culture and have excellent schools?;school

188384;Vallejo Participatory Budget;"Despite my brief living experience in Vallejo for just about a year, personal safety in my opinion is my major concern. According to the FBI , Vallejo is 6th most dangerous city in the Bay Area, on average 8.61 out of 1,000 resident in Vallejo committed at least 1 violent crime, which includes homicide, murder, assault, manslaughter, sexual assault, rape, robbery, negligence, endangerment, kidnapping (abduction), extortion, and harassment. This really troubles me because I could never let my guard down once I leave my doorstep, I had to constantly observe my surroundings and look for potential dangers, ‚Ä?get in & get out‚Äù is my personal rule of thumb every time I walk on Vallejo streets. 



To solve the crime issue in Vallejo, I propose hiring more law enforcements. According to CNN , after the police force was cut down by 40%, crime rate surged with more than two dozen homicides, compared to only seven in 2006. This demonstrates that crime rate has an association with the amount of law enforcements, which suggests that as more police roam around the streets, less probable criminals will likely commit a crime. Vallejo is a wonderful place to live in, the weather and the scenic is absolutely stunning, the only thing keeping wealthy and or morally good people from living here is the crime rate. Once it has been dealt with, I am certain the overall income per household in Vallejo would rise and the city will once again be able to self-run without the help from the government, making Vallejo even a better place to live in.

188419;Vallejo Schools (High Schools) Bathroom problem & educational quality;"As a fourth-year high school student in Jesse Bethel, I have noticed many things I and fellow peers have grown critical over. The wide spread complaint all students share would be the issues with our restrooms. They are unsanitary and without resources. There is never any soap, tissue, working locks in the bathroom stalls, adequate mirrors or lighting. Out of all the things we request to be fixed in our school, restrooms would be a great place to start. Having a restroom is a necessity in the 7 hours we are in school, but the horrible state it is in discourages many students from actually using them. Also, not having any soap is completely unsanitary after using the toilet and can spread germs after leaving the restroom. Fixing the state of our restrooms would improve the quality of comfort in Jesse Bethel, and other schools as well if implemented to all Vallejo schools.

Another thing I found to be frustrating is the academy structure. While some believe it is helpful for students to explore fields in their desired profession, it creates more confusion for undecided students and wastes one period with an academy class they are uninterested in. I propose an investment on increasing educational program quality in Vallejo high schools to assist students in finding potential interests for a future profession. I believe they can do this in two ways. The academy structure does not have to fully disappear. But the addition of giving the students a chance to not claim an academy or having students be able to experience all academies would be a great addition to give students more autonomy of their own educational experience. Letting a student experience all academies and not having to commit to one allows them to experiment with completely different fields to determine which suits them best. This system is helpful for the completely oblivious and indecisive students who are interested in a myriad of subjects. The other choice to allow a no academy allows students to explore interests through the classes they choose. For example, they can choose extra math classes or elective classes to explore their interests which they may have been unable to do if their schedules were blocked by an academy class. This leads to my other point to invest in our educational programs, such as physical education, science, and art departments. A higher quality education would involve a higher quality and quantity resources to improve and expand our learning abilities. For example, lab equipment to perform more lab experiments in our science classes. Also, the creation of varied classes would help students experiment with new subjects. These improvements can outcome in a higher student involvement and interest in education and a further exploration of career choices.";school

It features a large kitchen and counter surfaces where chefs can teach groups (up to 20?) plus large dining tables so that attendees can sit down and eat together.  Stocked with kitchen utensils and dishes.  This is different than a rec center because it is much nicer, cozier and suitable for use by any group that needs a larger space than a home to host a dinner.

Recommend a great place to do this is near the open space across from Mare Island between the Mare Island Bridge and Hwy 37 or at the county fair grounds so you can create good parking and easy access from multiple directions.  As an example look what a town of 5,100 can do when you do it right! In Canton, ""Texas the tradition began with district court meetings held on the first Monday of each month, or with the monthly visit of neighbors. The custom began with the swapping of surplus stock by barter and grew to include casual bargaining for or swapping of dogs, antiques, junk, and donkeys on a 30-acre (120,000 m2) grounds. It is so immensely popular, that Canton goes from a town of 5,100 to a town of over 300,000 during the first Monday weekend, making it the largest flea market in the world.""

The added benefit of a place to peddle our surplus belongings would provide a far safer atmosphere than online when selling things to strangers, as well as ensuring items go to a good home as opposed to the landfill potentially. Vallejo's entreprenureal spirit should have an informal place to thrive and provide a little pocket money for sellers while shoppers get to find perfectly good used items to save their hard-earned money. I believe in avoiding chain stores whenever possible and buying local first. It wouldnt take much to compete with Concord and bring another popular venue (and current eyesore) back to life, even if we had to start with the flea market, then progress to developing the drive-in improvements using those profits over time.;retail

The logo is prominently visible as one travels onto Mare Island from Vallejo, CA.

  Mare Island Naval Shipyard employees and U.S. Navy personnel have a proud tradition of service on Mare Island, and the Mare Island logo mounted over the causeway was a bright, shiny symbol of the future, the state of our jobs and the Navy‚Äôs mission to build and repair ships.  Sadly, that same logo is fading away, just as the many memories we all had of the greatest and oldest Naval Base and Shipyard on the West Coast.

  Help us preserve the history of Mare Island, and the memory of the employees whose contributions and sacrifice of American labor created the oldest naval shipyard on the west coast of the United States. The 20th anniversary of closing Mare Island was on April 1, 2016.

  We estimate that it will take anywhere from $5 to $25,000 in funds will be required to restore the logo. As a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization, the Mare Island Historic Park Foundation receives no funds from the U.S. Navy, and relies on the generous gifts and contributions of individual donors and corporate sponsors. All gifts are tax deductible and are recognized appropriately. 

 We will update our efforts on our websites: www.mareislandlogo.org  and www.mareislandlabor.org

Seats need to be improved. The place is dirty.  The place need to improved, newer equipment brought in and painted.

180071;NEW Boys & Girls Club!!! ;"Vallejo's youth truly need a POSITIVE PLACE where they can go to



They have no options; other than hanging in the streets; and this often leads to petty crimes; which tends to gravitate to more serious crimes as they get older.



GVRD is great, but they do not serve the demographic that is in dire need:



*Our youth need mentorship, guidance, and discipline 

*They need to feel wanted & important 

*They need to be encouraged and supported 

*They need a place that promotes self-discovery; a place that caters to their various interests 

*They need to learn accountability, integrity, and resposibility

*...and most of all, they need a place they WANT to go to, to have fun!

172204;Vallejo Indy Film Class: Youth-Crew only HD Video feature film;"Funds are for VALLEJO INDY FILM CLASS: a Youth-only Crew for a High-Definition Video Feature Film project, July 2017. Project submitted by experienced small film writer-producer, local downtown artist Julian Phillips. Seeking $50,000 and up, to finance such as: a) ten to fifteen high-school students will participate on project for six months, July 2017 to Jan. 2018. b) under supervision, students will contract to create and produce all aspects of a 90-minute Independent Feature Film. c) work will proceed in Vallejo and locations nearby; students can be as creative as they wish within normal guidelines for drama, comedy, 'action', documentary, science-fiction, at least 90-min. d) completed 90-min feature film will become the property of the City of Vallejo under PB process terms. e) funds needed to operate a six-month 'after school' or 'weekends only' class or program, including field work and on-set locations, minor personal travel. Examples would include rental cameras, edit-bay, lights, costumes, props, permits and insurance, casting, music. f) Mr. Phillips may, or may not, be the Team Leader. Mr. Phillips is a downtown artist (known for his Twofish Guitar Shows), and has been teaching media arts classes since 2009, including award-winning entries in last year's Waterfront Weekend 'Troll Story' contest, written by students from his American Canyon classes. Other local video artists and teachers would be invited to lead. g) funds would necessarily provide a small 'stipend fee', for all participants, to motivate students (at for example $75 per month, each), and also secure semi-professional status and credits. h) ten to fifteen students (high school level or proficient), would take on all film-maker duties, such as cast or dramatic actors, camera and sound/lights, costumes, script and screenplay writing, director or team of directors, film-video editor(s), producer, computer, etc. The entire group would work together for six months on all aspects. i) by the end of the Class, students can recieve DVD copies of their work, can earn school credits, are awarded certificate of acheivement, can apply screen credits for professional Unions (such as SAG), and follow-up with distribution and release of the film-video, online such as Vimeo or Amazon Prime, and locally with a big Premiere Party (Empress Theater or similar venue), for the entire community to enjoy the finished film. 



The project would function much like a 'part time job' for teens and high school students interested in film-video arts. Six month's time period for completion would allow successful editing, post-production. Finished film could be entered in film-festivals, created as a web-series, and build resumes and confidence. Students may be low-income or from abusive backgrounds, (with guidance). Vallejo High School and City of Vallejo would be invited to participate in the process on certain aspects

190087;Clean Air Monitoring Network - No Measurements means No Management!;"Don't Take Clean Air for Granted!



With the September 20, 2016  toxic fume incident (concurrent with Phillips 66 oil spill), It is very clear that neither BAAQMD (Bay are air quality management district) nor city of Vallejo has the infrastructure/capability to monitor the air quality, let alone the ability to alert citizens of harm.



This post is a call for action to start a ""Clean Air Monitoring Network"" PB project to start this effort.



Vallejo has very high asthma rate, do we know why? Who are the polluters? Is it from the heavy industries in the city? is it from the refinery outside of the city? Who do you think will identify the polluting sources for us? Who?....If not ourselves?



More specifically, black population in our city has as high as 5 times the ER visit rate (due to asthma) when compared with state average and for all residents, the ER visit rate is as high as 2.5 times the state average. This extra high ER visit rate is not acceptable and has to be looked into.



As the saying goes, "" No measurements, no management."" So the first goal of the ""Clean Air Monitoring Network"" is to establish monitoring stations in different part of the city and establish baseline measurement of air quality.



Once we have the baseline measurements, then we can monitor changes and keep our air clean.



This project will take a group effort to accomplish and will benefit many residents in the city.";air

It won‚Äôt hurt to clean our city just a bit, considering that animals around here are feeding off of the garbage being thrown around.

This isn‚Äôt needed just around neighborhoods, but around Vallejo schools as well. Students should have the opportunity to help the custodians clean up our schools, and volunteer hours should also be given when completing this task.

187508;Encouraging Business Advancement ;I have been a citizen of Vallejo since 2001.For the past six years, I have been a resident of the  College Park neighborhood of Northern Vallejo. As everyone knows, a few months ago, Food 4 Less closed for business permanently. Currently, there are sparse business establishments in that shopping square. I propose an idea that more businesses are installed. It is in a good location and easily accessible for both patrons of Vallejo, American Canyon, Napa and surrounding towns. Several years ago when Walmart moved from Vallejo to American Canyon, there were promises of a Home Depot being placed there. But so far, I have not seen any progress being made  into this project. I don't know if the plan was just hearsay or the building project was detained due to low funding. But whatever the reason,  the building has been trespassed by transients in the past. I realize that the homeless situation in Vallejo is unfortunately prevalent. Personally,  I feel that if more businesses were brought into that shopping square, it would bring in new job opportunities for the citizens of Vallejo. It would also give the homeless an opportunity to get on their feet and get a chance of living productive lives for themselves and their families. The plazas where Century Theaters and Seafood City are situated are doing pretty well for themselves business-wise. It would be wonderful and a great business advancement to see an additional plaza in Vallejo doing successfully as well.;retail,shopping

190427;Establish  Urban Farming in South Vallejo;"There is a huge unused lot in the borders of the Community Center and the Grace Paterson Elementary School which can be converted to a moderate size urban farm.  Urban Farming will not only give Vallejoans an alternative healthy choice of fresh produce 365 days every year, but it will also give a chance to the unemployed deserving Vallejoans the pride of a  hard day's work and learn new trade that can eventually turn into steady income. 



The 2016 General Plan on its way to be approved calls for Urban Farming in South Vallejo, which is most fitting considering that the area needs much needed boost.  The PB dollar will spearhead that long awaited plan to give the residents and business owners in this part of town the pride of being where they are.  The idea is not new,

its been tested in hundreds of small and large cities all over USA.  Many parks, front yards and vacant lands are being used for urban farming, rather than remain in blighted condition.



The open space between Grace Paterson Elelmentary School and the Community Center are presently maintained by the GVRD with lawns that need to be kept clean and green regualrly.  This lawn can be replaced with vegetable, fruit, herb and many other green farms that will benefit the neighboring community and the rest of Vallejoans, hundredfold than what this open space is being used at present.



This project idea had been presented to PB in the past, but unfortunately missed deadline of submissions and the many hours of research and studies did not result to anything.  Its a worthy project that has not seen light of  day, and therefore we are trying it again and hopefully this time around, Vallejoans will see the need and the benefits that this project.";gardens

188387;Eyes on the Sky;"Consistently in Vallejo on the Fourth of July, there are two fundamental spots where firecrackers are shown: Discovery Kingdom and the waterfront. I discover this an issue as a result of one thing, the geology of Vallejo. There are 125,000 individuals in Vallejo and not every one of them is going to need to go to those two firecrackers shows. Indeed, not everybody is going to stay in Vallejo to praise the firecrackers shows in the city. Be that as it may, a ton of the subjects in Vallejo stay at home on the fourth and due to the geography and size of the city, having the capacity to see the showcases can be unthinkable, again relying upon where you are in Vallejo amid the presentations. 



Presently this thought may sound somewhat insane, however an additional firecrackers showcase can do ponders for the city on the fourth of July. Of Course that will cost cash, and despite the fact that it's nothing genuine like attempting to settle the streets and roads in the city or discovering approaches to enhance our school, yet it is a thought I am certain very few individuals have conveyed to the table. So that is the reason I suggest that the city think about including as an additional firecrackers showcase for the fourth of July in the years to come.";events

187964;Illegal Dumping;"                                                          Participatory Budget Proposal

     Illegal dumping has become a big problem in Vallejo. People randomly throw their trash in alleys, sidewalks, and other public places. The fact is that this needs to change because it can be dangerous not only to us, but to our pets and to the environment that we live in. 

     One reason to why people end up illegally dumping their trash is because it is expensive to pay for it to be picked up, meaning throwing in the nearest isolated alley can be an easy solution. But this can change if trash collection was more affordable. Vallejo is not full of well-paid residents; instead, Vallejo faces a low-intermediate economic intake by majority of its residents so not paying another high bill is seen as a favorable choice.

     Affordable maintenance services should be more affordable and be based on a household salary, which will allow more people to afford these kinds of services. If this kind of system is allowed then amounts of trash dumped in public areas can be subject to lower.

     Another solution to this problem is to reinforce illegal dumping regulations. One way this can happen is if authorities patrol areas in which dumping is most active. If the individuals see the authorities near the area, then they are bound to think twice before doing it. With this said, if residents see changes then they‚Äôre also bound to rethink and take action for them by making sure areas are kept clean. For example a neighborhood watch can be created. The city of Vallejo has caring and reasonable residents, which is why the Participatory Budget is in place, so help by residents is not a problem. 

      These are some ways to help reduce illegal dumping in our city, but there‚Äôs many more and in the end it will be beneficial for all of us because we all live in this wonderful, but trashed and poorly taken care of city. Vallejo can be a great city, but it all starts with its environment so even if there are plenty of destinations, the way it‚Äôs taken care of is very important.

187714;Improving Community Events;"   I believe that Vallejo is becoming a more United city ever since the bankruptcy in 2008. We have been able to climb back up due to all the contributions of the people living in Vallejo. Looking at other cities that I have been able to visit, I have seen many cities that have parks full of people enjoying the sun. One city that caught my attention had an outside stage where people were able to perform and grass surrounding the stage where spectators can enjoy their performance. Not only that but next to the grassy area, There was a park where kids were playing. This very much intrigued me. I saw this city on a friday afternoon when the kids have finished their school and parents have already gotten out of work. Their city was so lively. I wondered if we can have this in Vallejo. 

        Vallejo is starting to reunite with its spirit of happiness. For example, in the waterfront, some events have been going on there like the food trucks parking on the grassy area and selling their goods. These things help our community grow and reunite. I believe that it would be a great idea if we make an outdoor stage somewhere in the downtown Vallejo area. Though we may have the Saturday Farmers Market, downtown Vallejo populations have declined throughout the years. Downtown Vallejo is suppose to be the place where people would want to go on a Friday afternoon. Either to enjoy the community or have a family outing to eat. The outdoor stage would be a great way to attract performers who would like to perform and people who would like to watch. The budget that would be used to make the stage could be paid off by a fee from performers who would like to use the stage and by spectators who would like to watch.

A community goat farm would not only keep the weeds down and reduce fire danger, but also produce local artisanal cheeses.

Cottage industries of this type on the island would be a proud Vallejo industry that people from the region would like to visit as opposed to a cement plant.

188397;Mare Island Revitalization;"Mare Island used to be a very prestigious part of Vallejo. What used to be the first naval base on the west coast has turned into a run down area. Although there are parts of Mare Island that may seem a bit aesthetic, it is evident that Mare Island needs a bit of revitalization. There are many square feet of vacant space in Mare Island that could be put to good use. There are also many empty and run-down buildings that could be used for things such as cost-friendly, city regulated, apartments affordable for the low income. 

There are many instances of fires and vandalism that has occurred in Mare Island because of these vacant buildings. One of these buildings could even be restructured as a homeless shelter. We can also create jobs in Vallejo by introducing more companies to Mare Island. Mare Island is a fairly large place with a great amount of empty space. If we utilize that space, we could not only increase the aesthetic of Mare Island, but we can open to more jobs, provide and shelter the homeless, and even accommodate those who are financially struggling.

188145;Outlets Proposal;"Shopping outlets are a place where people can relax, do some retail therapy, and also get away from what they may face outside of that shopping center.

Vallejo is a community that is filled with exploring adolescents and people with beautiful characteristics. However, due to Vallejo being seen as a ‚Ä?ghetto‚Äù community by those who live outside of the city, the children and people can sometimes believe what they hear and not expect better from themselves. With this in mind, a shopping center/outlet can bring unity to the city by people, instead of being on the streets for various reasons, enjoying time in the outlets.  In addition to the outlets being a sort of get a way, the outlets bring the opportunity to get Vallejo to flourish even more into a well-developed city and can bring in money to the city.  Although the cost to build an outlet maybe be on the expensive side, the income of the outlets are more beneficial, giving this project more positives than negatives.";retail,shopping

190594;Public Beach at historical dry docks, Mare Island;I propose that one or both of the old, unused dry-docks directly across the Napa River from the Vallejo Ferry Building be transformed into a public sun and swimming location.

In the water, children play and teenagers and adults swim out within the guarding presence of the tall structured walls. Picnic tables and barbecue pits inhabit the western end towards the road. I believe this would create a public beach, something lacking in the Bay Area, and provide a free, natural alternative to the paid, chlorinated swimming pools. It would incorporate the history of the island and the city and provide a unique tourism destination as well as a resource for the city and its citizens. ;parks

I propose they we should make a sports complex which will have soccer/Football fields and baseball fields and maybe a gym for volleyball. Making this might be expensive but in the long run we can receive back the money we put into it by hosting tournaments for different sports also having fees to have teams practice there.

Having a sports complex to me, would keep young kids off the streets and put them into something productive. Sports in general brings people together, gives young kids future dreams and gives people something to look forward to. This sports complex would include all sports, baseball, football, basketball, soccer, tennis, and even a track/field area. This whole sports complex will bring people together because yeah we do have baseball fields and football fields and basketball courts in vallejo, but this will be in one area. This also could bring money back to vallejo because with sports you need to be hydrated so this will mean a snack bar will be needed. With sports there are teams, and with teams there are fans, and with fans there comes and entry fee. Also, there could be a fee charged for when local teams want to practice or use this wonderful new facility. 

This facility will bring life to Vallejo, and not just people from our community but from cities all around us. Everyday this complex will be filled with bright young kids or adults who enjoy playing sports. This complex will be a turf facility so that it will need minimum maintenance. This place to me is just a wonderful idea, and yes it might take a little longer than other ideas would but this one will make 10x more of a difference.

They fixed the soccer and football fields but the basketball courts and the batting cages need to be revamped. Injuries have been caused due to the uneven courts. People spending money on the batting cages and sometimes they won't work so its like you got ripped off. About the staying out of trouble because all athletes are competitive so there may be fights because people want to win so that's normal to me.

I think a solution could be to meet with citizens who aren't complying with the code, see if there is any way for them to comply and if not, build a screen for them to put their cans behind. This would cost fairly little money. I imagine that the screens could be built by an organization that helps folks fix up their homes. I know there is such a group that does work here in town, but I can't think of the name! The screens though, would not just be for low income folks, it could be any income level. I think something this simple would really improve the looks of our town.;beautification

PAL used to be subsidized through the Police Department's budget, but during the City's bankruptcy, all funding was cut to our program. We believe that the receipt of Measure B funding would help to continue our organization's ability to  provide low-cost activities to the youth of Vallejo. ;sports

188450;Waterfront Park;"The community of Vallejo is a diverse community that ranges of many races, culture, ethnicities, and ages. One main location that host all of these people would be the Vallejo Waterfront. Most adults go to the waterfront in order to enjoy the wind, sun, and scenery. These adults, that usually spend their days at the waterfront, are usually joggers, now Pokemon players, fishers, and daily commuters. More people would come to the waterfront if there is a new incentive.

There is a big area of land in the waterfront that is not being of use, except as open space. Yes, that space is beautiful for sailing kites. However, having one large area is enough. Since sailing kites in such a windy area is not usually successful. From what I remember of the waterfront, there are two large open spaces. One of those spaces, specially the more hilly area, could be the location of a new big park. 

Just like the famous park in Benicia, with its gigantic slide, it attracts people of all ages. It becomes a place of multiple visits and a fantastic gathering area. By building a park in the waterfront, more children will be lured to become more physically active and enjoy their time outside with other children.

Also, not only that. With the coming out of Pokemon Go, people are attracted to the area due to the stops and gyms found there. If there was a park there, they would have another location to sit and enjoy their game.



By bringing in a park in the waterfront, it will increase the businesses around that area. Since more people are coming down to the waterfront, it would become a more popular place to gather groups of people. The park would act as an advertisement and incentive to come to the beautiful waterfront of Vallejo City. ";tourism
189833;Waterfront Skate/BMX/Scooter Park;The current waterfront plans don't appear to include anything geared towards the youth. Concrete skate parks provide the best ROI (return on investment) for the cities that build them. They are extremely low maintenance, provide a safe space for healthy activities, and when built to the proper scale they become a destination for end users from all over the region. The new park in Napa is an excellent example of this. Vallejo could do one better by placing it at the waterfront & thereby putting the park in an area easily accessible by many forms of transportation. It would also be closer to businesses which will benefit from added traffic by not only the users of the park, but also by those (such as parents) that may transport or accompany users of the park.

167984;Yoga Program for most challenged schools in the district;"Yoga has a proven positive impact on children's ability to focus, their resiliency, and their behavior. If a major goal of the school district is to make the schools safer, a yoga program with a strong record of success would be advisable. 

I would suggest Niroga Yoga, which handles yoga for youth programs in schools in San Leandro, Oakland, Richmond, Berkeley and others. They have a well established, thoroughly researched program and years of experience bringing this program to schools.
