OPENING A YOUTH CENTER IN VALLEJO, CALIFORNIA;My name is Kyler Thompson. I am a Vallejo residence. I have had tons and tons of experience working with youth and the community. I have volunteered over six thousand hours of community service. I know with my expertise and my commitment that I can produce something amazing and successful. My vision is to create a better way of living, working and succeeding in the Vallejo community. This is possible by enduring in the community needs and provide positive and hard working actions that will reassure the community that leadership is here. I want to lead our youth. With the support of the community I KNOW WE CAN DO THIS! SUPPORT ME AS I STRIVE TO MAKE A CHANGE!;rec center

Support programs;"Vallejo is known as one of the most ""dangerous"" cities in the nation. When you ask another NorCal resident what they think of Vallejo, their response most likely has something to do with the crimes that happen in our city. In my opinion, I strongly believe we can put a stop to this. I believe the crime that happens has a lot to do with the economic factors that take place in a city like Vallejo. However, people can change even if the economy cannot. Despite the reputation of Vallejo, people only point out the negatives but listen little to Vallejo‚Äôs positive side. Perception on life has a lot to do with a person‚Äôs actions. Many choose to commit a burglary or robbery because they feel like they have no other choice. Many choose to murder because they would do anything to get what they want. Many of these people feel alone and helpless and need help they don‚Äôt think they need. 

As a teenage resident of Vallejo, I understand the stress a lot of people my age go through. Many Vallejo teens come from families that barely make enough to get by. While some take on part time jobs, others result to what seems much simpler- robbery. I believe if Vallejo set up or encouraged a support group for teenagers and adults in need, there would not be as many crimes in our city. Many people just need advice or help to get on the right track. A mentor system would also be a great idea. This may consist of a person guiding a struggling person to get a job, for instance. Many people are seeking for guidance they do not get from their homes. Large numbers of residents in Vallejo do not get the support they need.";mentoring

Drive-ins;Judging by the immense success of the Solano Drive-in/swap-meets in Concord, Vallejo would be wise to capitalize on that family-friendly market. Many 40-something's and up remember the Vallejo drive-ins as a valued, multi-generation tradition and reminisce fondly. The added benefit of a place to peddle our surplus belongings would provide a far safer atmosphere than online when selling things to strangers, as well as ensuring items go to a good home as opposed to the landfill potentially. Vallejo's entreprenureal spirit should have an informal place to thrive and provide a little pocket money for sellers while shoppers get to find perfectly good used items to save their hard-earned money. I believe in avoiding chain stores whenever possible and buying local first. It wouldnt take much to compete with Concord and bring another popular venue (and current eyesore) back to life, even if we had to start with the flea market, then progress to developing the drive-in improvements using those profits over time.;retail

Sports complex;"Vallejo's budgeting system should use the Measure B tax dollars on a sports complex. Having a sports complex to me, would keep young kids off the streets and put them into something productive. Sports in general brings people together, gives young kids future dreams and gives people something to look forward to. This sports complex would include all sports, baseball, football, basketball, soccer, tennis, and even a track/field area. This whole sports complex will bring people together because yeah we do have baseball fields and football fields and basketball courts in vallejo, but this will be in one area. This also could bring money back to vallejo because with sports you need to be hydrated so this will mean a snack bar will be needed. With sports there are teams, and with teams there are fans, and with fans there comes and entry fee. Also, there could be a fee charged for when local teams want to practice or use this wonderful new facility. 

This facility will bring life to Vallejo, and not just people from our community but from cities all around us. Everyday this complex will be filled with bright young kids or adults who enjoy playing sports. This complex will be a turf facility so that it will need minimum maintenance. This place to me is just a wonderful idea, and yes it might take a little longer than other ideas would but this one will make 10x more of a difference. I have no further ideas for this project, but feel free to add to it when you choose this idea for the Vallejo Participatory Budgeting project.";sports

Vallejo education ;As residents here in Vallejo and have the ability to considered one idea in the Vallejo participatory budget process I request a better education. Just as here in the Vallejo high schools we have a low ranking of our schools. Our community should improve this problem as Vallejo schools don't have good material which makes  people believe that Vallejo schools are bad and not learning schools. As a resident here in Vallejo and I had the experience in attending both high schools in Vallejo we need to make a change for our community education. We need to improve  our security,classrooms, bathrooms, cafeteria  and teachers. Security in Vallejo schools have been a big problem us students here in Vallejo don't feel safe as recently these pass years we had big lockdowns and death. We need to improve Vallejo schools and make a change. The classrooms need more modern look just as the generation is changing and we are being paperless. Also bathrooms should be remolded and maintain clean. Also the cafeteria should also be remolded and we shouldn't have frozen food  they want us to eat healthy but is frozen food  healthy? No it's not we should have fresh food. Lastly, Vallejo teachers should be trained in the new technology. Teachers here in Vallejo don't know how to use of the new material.

Establish  Urban Farming in South Vallejo;"There is a huge unused lot in the borders of the Community Center and the Grace Paterson Elementary School which can be converted to a moderate size urban farm.  Urban Farming will not only give Vallejoans an alternative healthy choice of fresh produce 365 days every year, but it will also give a chance to the unemployed deserving Vallejoans the pride of a  hard day's work and learn new trade that can eventually turn into steady income. 



The 2016 General Plan on its way to be approved calls for Urban Farming in South Vallejo, which is most fitting considering that the area needs much needed boost.  The PB dollar will spearhead that long awaited plan to give the residents and business owners in this part of town the pride of being where they are.  The idea is not new,

its been tested in hundreds of small and large cities all over USA.  Many parks, front yards and vacant lands are being used for urban farming, rather than remain in blighted condition.



The open space between Grace Paterson Elelmentary School and the Community Center are presently maintained by the GVRD with lawns that need to be kept clean and green regualrly.  This lawn can be replaced with vegetable, fruit, herb and many other green farms that will benefit the neighboring community and the rest of Vallejoans, hundredfold than what this open space is being used at present.



This project idea had been presented to PB in the past, but unfortunately missed deadline of submissions and the many hours of research and studies did not result to anything.  Its a worthy project that has not seen light of  day, and therefore we are trying it again and hopefully this time around, Vallejoans will see the need and the benefits that this project.";gardens

Vallejo Participatory Budget;"Despite my brief living experience in Vallejo for just about a year, personal safety in my opinion is my major concern. According to the FBI , Vallejo is 6th most dangerous city in the Bay Area, on average 8.61 out of 1,000 resident in Vallejo committed at least 1 violent crime, which includes homicide, murder, assault, manslaughter, sexual assault, rape, robbery, negligence, endangerment, kidnapping (abduction), extortion, and harassment. This really troubles me because I could never let my guard down once I leave my doorstep, I had to constantly observe my surroundings and look for potential dangers, ‚Ä?get in & get out‚Äù is my personal rule of thumb every time I walk on Vallejo streets. 



To solve the crime issue in Vallejo, I propose hiring more law enforcements. According to CNN , after the police force was cut down by 40%, crime rate surged with more than two dozen homicides, compared to only seven in 2006. This demonstrates that crime rate has an association with the amount of law enforcements, which suggests that as more police roam around the streets, less probable criminals will likely commit a crime. Vallejo is a wonderful place to live in, the weather and the scenic is absolutely stunning, the only thing keeping wealthy and or morally good people from living here is the crime rate. Once it has been dealt with, I am certain the overall income per household in Vallejo would rise and the city will once again be able to self-run without the help from the government, making Vallejo even a better place to live in.

NEW Boys & Girls Club!!! ;"Vallejo's youth truly need a POSITIVE PLACE where they can go to



They have no options; other than hanging in the streets; and this often leads to petty crimes; which tends to gravitate to more serious crimes as they get older.

*Our youth need mentorship, guidance, and discipline 

*They need to feel wanted & important 

*They need to be encouraged and supported 

*They need a place that promotes self-discovery; a place that caters to their various interests 

*They need to learn accountability, integrity, and resposibility

*...and most of all, they need a place they WANT to go to, to have fun!

The Sportscenter needs to be fixed up because its all old and dusty, its not appealing to the eye anymore, on the outside or the inside. They fixed the soccer and football fields but the basketball courts and the batting cages need to be revamped. Injuries have been caused due to the uneven courts. People spending money on the batting cages and sometimes they won't work so its like you got ripped off. About the staying out of trouble because all athletes are competitive so there may be fights because people want to win so that's normal to me. Instead of being out at night hanging out, going to parties, getting unwanted attention by police or people who look like their up to no good, they could just down to the Sportscenter and get better at the sport they love. ;sports

Being as though Mare Island will be boosting its visitor and employment opportunities in the near future why not encourage greater bike commuter access now to help reduce the inevitability of more traffic.  Tennessee would be a perfect place to start this process, green lane indication for all bike commuters improving safety, health and the environment. ;bikes

Student Support for Social & Emotional Needs ;Students currently attending VCUSD schools have no Counselors in place to help support them through severe social-emotional needs. Our youth of Vallejo are in desperate need of the support that Counselors offer and the value they can add to the educational system overall. As a former VCUSD student, it was imperative that we were provided Counselors. While a student, I was helped: educationally, socially and emotionally, by very influential Counselors from within our community. The Counselors would also follow students throughout our whole middle and high school careers. Relationships were built and trust was established over years of interactions. Our youth today need even more access to properly trained adults that are in place to simply listen and mentor them on a consistent basis. Full Service Community Schools can not be successful without the reimplementation of full time Counselors in middle schools and high schools. ;school

Create an Upscale Flea Market;"We need to generate business in the community and vision for growth. An upscale flea Market that is family friendly and not over priced to have space can create a wonderful environment to incubate new business. This ought to be done with a minimum of 30 acres of land. Recommend a great place to do this is near the open space across from Mare Island between the Mare Island Bridge and Hwy 37 or at the county fair grounds so you can create good parking and easy access from multiple directions.  As an example look what a town of 5,100 can do when you do it right! In Canton, ""Texas the tradition began with district court meetings held on the first Monday of each month, or with the monthly visit of neighbors. The custom began with the swapping of surplus stock by barter and grew to include casual bargaining for or swapping of dogs, antiques, junk, and donkeys on a 30-acre (120,000 m2) grounds. It is so immensely popular, that Canton goes from a town of 5,100 to a town of over 300,000 during the first Monday weekend, making it the largest flea market in the world."" Now that is worth developing and we can do this here in Vallejo and the numbers will swell up quickly. We do not have to be first in the market, just do it right in the market and people will come.

Mare Island Revitalization;"Mare Island used to be a very prestigious part of Vallejo. What used to be the first naval base on the west coast has turned into a run down area. Although there are parts of Mare Island that may seem a bit aesthetic, it is evident that Mare Island needs a bit of revitalization. There are many square feet of vacant space in Mare Island that could be put to good use. There are also many empty and run-down buildings that could be used for things such as cost-friendly, city regulated, apartments affordable for the low income. 

There are many instances of fires and vandalism that has occurred in Mare Island because of these vacant buildings. One of these buildings could even be restructured as a homeless shelter. We can also create jobs in Vallejo by introducing more companies to Mare Island. Mare Island is a fairly large place with a great amount of empty space. If we utilize that space, we could not only increase the aesthetic of Mare Island, but we can open to more jobs, provide and shelter the homeless, and even accommodate those who are financially struggling.

The schools of Vallejo;Education is the most important factor in which Vallejo should focus on. The city of Vallejo has schools that are doing well, but the school and its students cannot flourish because of the limited amount of money invested in them. Education will never fail, putting in money into Vallejo schools will improve each child's performance, reduce crime rates, and attract more people into the city. One of the benefits that would serve Vallejo for the long run is having students in school instead of them roaming around the streets. Our students have the potential to thrive but the quality of the school is what discourages them and feel as if they are degraded by their neighboring cities. Investing money to the schools of Vallejo is like watering seeds, give the children more resources and they will revolutionize the face of Vallejo. Ultimately, the schools will improve and new families would want to come into what Vallejo truly is, rich in culture and diversity. Who wouldn't want to come into a city that accepts every culture and have excellent schools?;school

School Resource Officer Parent Squad;Training parents on large crowd security, protection, surveillance, and riot control etc. Informational packets for employers to support the program by pledging hours the employee can take off during the year to participate making their children's school safer.  Include any tax incentives for the employer support.  Parents whose home naturally become the neighborhood kid magnet could be very beneficial as part of the resource officer support because they bring with them a rapport with a group of students.  Parents who are part of Vallejo's youth sports community have established relationships with many athletes and first hand knowledge of their temperaments that would also prove beneficial in promoting respectful, happy students.  I think parents patrolling the campus would bring a balance to the presence of law enforcement.  It has become necessary to have law enforcement present on our school grounds, but too much can create an atmosphere similar to the correctional officer guarding  prisoners on the yard and in turn students on the defense.  A parent safety squad would make it affordable for the district to implement while engaging the parent.   ;school
Education;"Our money should go to the schools. The schools are filled with trash everyday, less students are showing up because of this problem. Other students from different schools visit or vallejo schools for games and notice how dirty our schools are. This need to change quick. I believe this will engage students to come to school more often with a change in being more clean. 

   The money seems to be going to different things other then education. There were days when some students couldn't show up to school like for example the day after the gas spill. Students still had to show up because Vallejo doesn't have enough money for them not to miss school. There is many reasons where the money should go. This is only one big one.";school
FireFighter Youth Academy ;"I am a cadet at the FireFighter Youth Academy. This November 2016 will be their first year here in Vallejo. This Academy is know for three main things; Academic Achievement, Community Service, and Self-Discipline. In my own experience, I know these three things are being promoted and achieved. This Academy has brought me many opportunities for school and my future. As a senior, there are many things involving scholarships and applications. The staff has pushed me into keeping up my grades and helping me with the application process. This has helped me get that weight off of my shoulders. They truly want every single cadet to leave the program with set goal ahead of them. The staff is always looking for more ways to make us succeed in our everyday lives. They also teach you life essentials in case of emergency. For example, in these pasts 7/8 months, I have learned about fire safety, CRP, basic first-aid, and what to do during an earthquake. These are only the few subjects that we learn about. 

      This program is every Saturday except on holidays. From 9am-1pm. During those four hours, we are set up in squads, one person known as the lieutenant leads there squad to their assignment. The assignment could be cleaning inside, outside, washing the fire engine, or cooking breakfast for everyone. This has increased our responsibilities at home. I learned how to cooked. I heard from many of the other cadets that they started to do chores at home and cooking for their family, leaving them surprised as ever. Many has increased their GPA too. The program makes sure that we keep up our grades. They make sure that our GPA improves with providing resources for tutoring and we have to turn in a grade check, at the end of the month, if we increase or maintained our grades we get a stipend rewarding our hard work. Outside of the program, we try to volunteer in community events, helping the community to get to know who we are and giving back to them. 

If someone wanted to take their career in being a Firefighter or EMT, this would also bring a great opportunity. We meet other firefighters and EMT's every weekend. They tell us about their experience and if they want to continue with their occupation. Many EMT's also explain how they take this path first to get some experience before becoming a nurse or firefighter. A lot of cadet meet with their mentors. Cadets get to do ride alongs with EMT or spend a day at the fire station for more experience. 

In the end, the Firefighter Youth Academy brings many positive effect for young teens who want to go further 

in the Fire Department or becoming an EMT. They help us succeed in our academic life and persona life, making us better people.";youth activities

Revamp & Revitalize JFK Library;"As downtown Vallejo continues to develop and flourish, we should send the message to our community and visitors that we value and prioritize learning by revamping and revitalizing the JFK Library. Over the years the JFK Library has definitely lost its sparkle. It doesn't have the warm and inviting atmosphere that everyone looks for in a library. Instead it seems dirty, unappealing, and outdated. I purpose that the outside of the library is remodeled as many of the areas are now blocked off due to homeless encampments and the inside is supplied with new desks, carpet, etc. The JFK Library should serve as a centerpiece to our growing and vibrant downtown area.



In addition, I would love to see added services to the library, some ideas include:

--Workshops and classes for local businesses and entrepreneurs, such as marketing and social media (this will help the local economy)

--Tool library where you can borrow tools that you many only once in a while (this is a service the Berkeley library offers)

--Other services to develop the ""sharing economy"" in Vallejo
